Minimum requirements
====================

In order to build properly the C source code, you will need the
following components to be installed:

* cmake (\>= 2.8.3)
* gcc
* libc development files
* readline library (optional)

#### Ubuntu/Debian
You can install those by installing packages: cmake
build-essential libreadline5-dev

    apt-get install cmake build-essential libreadline5-dev

#### Fedora 
You have to install the "Development Tools" package
group and the cmake and readline-devel packages

    yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
    yum install cmake readline-devel

#### Arch
You can install those by installing all packages except the libc6 which is already installed
in the base system (development files included)

    pacman -S gcc cmake readline

Configure build system
======================

From this point in this document, we'll use MihiniAgentSources as the
root directory of Mihini agent sources. It must contains folders like
"bin", "cmake", "luafmk", "agent" etc.

MihiniAgentSources/cmake folder contains toolchains files (named
toolchain.\*) along with other files (but don't pay attention at other
files in cmake folder).\
 Each toolchain file defines a configuration for compiling the sources:

- (cross-)compiler configuration (most important ones)

        SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER /path/to/gcc)
        SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /path/to/g++)
        # where is the target environment
        SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /path/to/root/env)

- other build options related to Mihini Agent integration (those are more likely to be used for fine tuning a Mihini Agent integration, after it is already compiled and running)

It may also be interesting to make your own toolchains files to adapt
the build to your specific environment.

**WARNING**

- We strongly recommand you to use a the toolchain that was generated
  while creating the kernel/rootfs of the Linux system running on your
  device !
- When compiling on 'regular' personal computer, gcc compiler provided
  by "build-essential"-like package works out of the box for compiling
  the agent, as a result toolchain.default.cmake is almost empty!

Build
=====
    
#### Build the software

- It is strongly advised to run next line outside from MihiniAgentSources folder
  Output files are produced on working\_dir/build.$target folder, with
  $target equals to target specified in build.sh -t argument.

        ReadyAgentSources/bin/build.sh [-d] [-t <target>]

  Use `-d` to toggle debugging on

Use `-t <target>` to specify the build target. When no target is
specified, the default target (named "default") is used: it uses the
compiler for the host computer running the build.sh script, using
gcc/g++.

Available targets are the ones corresponding to the toolchain files in
`cmake` directory. Using non default targets will require to install
additional cross compiling toolchains.

#### Build artifacts details

- build.$target/runtime : the runtime folder contains all Mihini Agent artifacts that need to be integrated in the target device.
- build.$target/runtime/lib contains the libs you may need to link
  with when developing an application that works with ReadyAgent, like:
   - libSwi\_AirVantage.so
   - libSwi\_Sms.so
   - libSwi\_System.so
   - ...

- other files and folders in build.$target folder are CMake artifacts,
  don't modify them, you shouldn't need to look at them.

Run Mihini Agent
==============

Just start the agent in a command line terminal:

    cd build.default/runtime
    ./start.sh

You should see the logs of the Mihini Agent, something similar to:

**NOTE**

According to the version you downloaded and you built the header of the Agent might change (it includes version, git revision)

#### Mihini Agent shell

You can interact with the Mihini Agent by connecting to the Lua shell.
 When default settings are used, this is how to do it:

    $ telnet localhost

Once connected to the shell you can send commands.
Example, you can change a Mihini Agent config parameter:

    $ telnet localhost
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Lua interactive shell
    > agent.config.network.activate = false
    >

#### Mihini Agent configuration

To modify some of the Mihini Agent configuration parameters (like
communication ports, ...) you'll have to change the Mihini Agent Config.\
 This is explained in ConfigStore page.

Update build artifacts after source modifications
======================================================

This also applies when one wants to build artifacts that are not built
by default.

    #go to the build folder
    cd build.default
    # this one rebuilds all default targets if their dependencies have change.
    # Also it rebuilds cmake rules if those have changed.
    make
    # this one builds a specific target
    make some-target
